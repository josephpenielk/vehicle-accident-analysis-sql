# Accident Analysis Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Accident Analysis project! This project aims to explore and analyze data related to accidents and vehicles. The dataset is comprised of two main files: `accident.csv` and `vehicle.csv`. These files contain valuable information that can provide insights into various aspects of road safety.

## Dataset Overview

### Accident Data (`accident.csv`)

This dataset includes the following columns:

- `AccidentIndex`: Unique identifier for each accident.
- `Severity`: Severity level of the accident (e.g., 'Fatal', 'Serious', 'Slight').
- `Date`: Date of the accident.
- `Day`: Day of the week.
- `SpeedLimit`: Speed limit at the accident location.
- `LightConditions`: Light conditions at the time of the accident.
- `WeatherConditions`: Weather conditions at the time of the accident.
- `RoadConditions`: Road conditions at the time of the accident.
- `Area`: Area type (e.g., urban or rural).

### Vehicle Data (`vehicle.csv`)

This dataset includes the following columns:

- `VehicleID`: Unique identifier for each vehicle.
- `AccidentIndex`: Identifier linking the vehicle to a specific accident.
- `VehicleType`: Type of vehicle involved in the accident.
- `PointImpact`: Point of impact on the vehicle.
- `LeftHand`: Indicates whether the impact occurred on the left-hand side.
- `JourneyPurpose`: Purpose of the vehicle journey.
- `Propulsion`: Propulsion type of the vehicle.
- `AgeVehicle`: Age of the vehicle.

## Questions Explored

### 1. Accidents by Area Type
- How many accidents have occurred in urban areas versus rural areas?

### 2. Day of the Week Analysis
- Which day of the week has the highest number of accidents?

### 3. Average Age of Vehicles by Type
- What is the average age of vehicles based on their type?

### 4. Age of Vehicles Trends
- Can we identify any trends based on the age of the vehicle?

### 5. Weather Conditions and Severity
- Are there any specific weather conditions that contribute to severe accidents?

### 6. Left-Hand Impacts
- Do accidents often involve impacts on the left-hand side of vehicles?

### 7. Journey Purpose and Severity
- Are there any relationships between journey purpose and the severity of the accident?

### 8. Average Age of Vehicles by Light Conditions and Point of Impact
- Calculate the average age of vehicles involved in accidents, considering daylight and point of impact.

## Conclusion

This project's analysis provides valuable insights into various aspects of road safety, including factors influencing accident severity, trends based on the age of vehicles, and the impact of weather conditions and journey purposes. The findings can contribute to a better understanding of road safety measures and inform relevant authorities to take appropriate actions.
